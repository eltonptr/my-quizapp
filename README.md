Purpose: -
The website will serve as a platform for anyone to host a set of questionnaires as part of a survey,
evaluation, etc. The host can come back and improve the questions at any point in time. He can
also maintain any number of quizzes and schedule them. More importantly we can send invites to
other people to take the quiz which will be integrated into the system. The most attractive feature
would be the ability to conduct live quizzes.

Reason: -
Even though we have Google forms and similar forms and surveys from Microsoft, it’s hard to
find a centralized application just to create, host and maintain quizzes. The lack of better graphical
representation of the quiz responses is also another motivation for building this application.

Goal: -
The goal of this website is to become a go to site for hosting or taking a quiz to challenge yourself
or be a part of a survey. Also achieve an active user count of 100k.

Target Audience: -
    School – students and faculty
    Corporate – Employer and Employee
    Public Global Surveys
