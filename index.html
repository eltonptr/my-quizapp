        <h2>Welcome to My Quiz App!</h2>
        <p>The website will serve as a platform for anyone to host a set of questionnaires as part of a survey,
            evaluation, etc. The host can come back and improve the questions at any point in time. He can
            also maintain any number of quizzes and schedule them. More importantly we can send invites to
            other people to take the quiz which will be integrated into the system. The most attractive feature
            would be the ability to conduct live quizzes.</p>
        <h2>Reason</h2>
        <p>Even though we have Google forms and similar forms and surveys from Microsoft, itâ€™s hard to
            find a centralized application just to create, host and maintain quizzes. The lack of better graphical
            representation of the quiz responses is also another motivation for building this application
